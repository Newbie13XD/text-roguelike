# Text Roguelike

## What's this?

I made this in the middle of 2018. It's not the best thing I've written, but
I learnt a lot doing it. As for what it is, it's a very primitive roguelike.

## Building

### Linux

Run `make` inside the ASCII Roguelike directory. You will then get an
executable called rogue which you can run.

### Windows

Unfortunately I had no idea what I was doing when making this so building on
Windows may or may not be configured properly. I do not use Windows any more
and Visual Studio is not available on Linux so unfortunately I cannot speak for
whether this works or how to do it.
